Aim: To study and implement C++ Program Structure and Data Types.


Software Used: VS Code.

Theory: 


Data types in C++ define the kind of data a variable can hold, ensuring memory is used efficiently and operations behave predictably. They are broadly classified into primitive, derived, and user-defined types.
Primitive types include int, float, double, char, and bool, used for basic values like integers, decimals, characters, and logical results. Derived types, like arrays and pointers, build on primitives to manage collections and memory addresses. User-defined types (structs, unions, enums, and classes) allow custom data structures.
Each data type has a specific size (platform-dependent) and range. Understanding these helps manage memory and avoid overflow or precision loss.
Mastery of data types is crucial for writing robust code, optimizing performance, and building scalable systemsâ€”especially in domains like embedded systems and real-time applications.


Syntax: 

    int age = 25;
    float temperature = 36.5;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool isActive = true;
    double pi = 3.14159;

Conclusion: Understanding C++ data types is key to managing memory and controlling program behavior. From integers to custom structures, mastering their syntax and purpose helps create efficient, reliable, and scalable code across diverse applications and domains.
